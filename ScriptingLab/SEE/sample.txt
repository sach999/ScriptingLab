There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now ï»¿the memories are on the wall
I hear the sounds from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world,
Thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs, reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
